ReactJS is a tool for building user interfaces. The structure of a React application is similar to web components, where a UI is composed of multiple components. Each component and its children can be rendered in HTML. ReactJS renders your components in a virtual DOM, which is compared to the existing DOM to intelligently apply DOM manipulations to your page. This is much more efficient compared to doing the full rendering in the browser DOM.</p>\n<p><a href=\"2\">Firebase</a> is a real time key-value store. Using Firebase&#39;s Javascript API, the browser receives updates whenever something is changed on the server.</p>\n<p>These two libraries work amazingly well together.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qaYESiT-358\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<h3 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h3>\n<p>I had a CMS running on my server at the time, so I modified it to use Firebase and ReactJS. At a high level, it&#39;s very simple. I had a ReactJS component called a &quot;Renderable&quot; that queries the Firebase store to get the text, which is then compiled to HTML (if it is formatted in markdown). When Firebase receives an update from the server, an event is triggered that causes the &quot;Renderable&quot; to render again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-i-ve-learned\">What I&#39;ve learned</h3>\n<p>This was my first front-end project outside of AngularJS, so I was pretty enthusiastic about it. I&#39;m always excited to learn new frameworks and architectures.</p>\n"}
