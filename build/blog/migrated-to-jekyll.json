It was pretty easy since I didn&#39;t have that many posts.</p>\n<p>Jekyll makes managing my site incredibly easy by compiling text files into a directory containing a static website, and is way more convenient than using a conventional content management system.</p>\n<p>My personal website/blog setup so far:\nI keep my site content on my VPS, and run this command within a screen session:</p>\n<pre><code>jekyll build --source /home/desmond/deslee-jekyll --destination /path/to/http/root --watch\n</code></pre><p>The <code>--watch</code> option tells Jekyll to watch for changes in any of my source files, and regenerate the destination files automatically.</p>\n<p>Next, I <a href=\"http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html\">sshfs</a> my Jekyll source directory onto my home computer and open up the files in my text editor. When I save the files, the Jekyll process will generate the corresponding HTML files, and changes will appear on my site almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://raw2.github.com/deslee/deslee-jekyll/master/_posts/2014-01-24-migrated-to-jekyll.md\">raw text data</a> of this blog post.</p>\n<p>Finally, I use Git with my Jekyll directory for revision control.</p>\n<p>This makes it much easier than logging into a cms backend, using a web based editor, and submitting my content to the server to be stored on a database.</p>\n<p>To read more about Jekyll, read what its creator has to say about it in his blog post, <a href=\"http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html\">Blogging Like a Hacker</a></p>\n"}
